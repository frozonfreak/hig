# Machine-readable rules — The Web HIG

Layer 7 defines how requirements become **deterministic** for linters, CI, and AI agents. This document describes what exists today and the path to a full rule registry.

**Normative source:** [HIG.md §7](./HIG.md#layer-7-ai--agent-enforcement-contract) · **Module:** [rules/ai-enforcement.md](./rules/ai-enforcement.md)

## Today (v1.18.0)

| Artifact | Format | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [rules/manifest.yaml](./rules/manifest.yaml) | YAML | Progressive loading: layers, modules, triggers, rule ID lists per module |
| [rules/motion-tiers.yaml](./rules/motion-tiers.yaml) | YAML | Motion Tier 0–3 + ambient class; surface permission matrix (**HIG-EXP-006**) |
| Agent templates | Markdown + YAML | Layer 7 guardrails in [examples/agent-rules/](./examples/agent-rules/) |
| Agent skill | [skills/web-hig/SKILL.md](./skills/web-hig/SKILL.md) | Ready-to-copy Agent Skill for Cursor, Claude, Copilot, Windsurf |
| Installer | [packages/install](./packages/install/) | `npx @web-hig/install` pins HIG-QUICK + rules/skills |
| Rule IDs in prose | `HIG-*` in HIG.md and `rules/*.md` | Human and agent citation |
| [rules/registry.yaml](./rules/registry.yaml) | YAML | Rule registry: severity, profiles, archetypes, evaluation, autofix, module, HIG section |
| [rules/quick-rule-map.yaml](./rules/quick-rule-map.yaml) | YAML | Layer 1 Quick # ↔ `HIG-*` ID links (`npm run sync:quick-map`) |
| [scripts/validate-hig.mjs](./scripts/validate-hig.mjs) | JavaScript | Single source of truth: VERSION sync, registry ↔ INDEX ↔ manifest ↔ Quick map, docs/adopter pins |
| [@web-hig/core](./packages/core/) | JavaScript | Config + registry loader + evaluator report helpers |
| [@web-hig/cli](./packages/cli/) | JavaScript | `web-hig` — `init`, `check`, `explain` (audit/upgrade planned) |
| [rules/evaluator-dimensions.yaml](./rules/evaluator-dimensions.yaml) | YAML | Evaluator dimension ↔ rule prefix map |
| [schema/evaluator-report.schema.json](./schema/evaluator-report.schema.json) | JSON Schema | Multidimensional evaluator report shape |
| [EVALUATOR.md](./EVALUATOR.md) | Markdown | Evaluator contract (Layer 8 §8.2) |
| [rules/agent-consumption.yaml](./rules/agent-consumption.yaml) | YAML | Maturity, browser target, fallback, automated checks, manual checks, and source date for accessibility, forms, motion, and performance rules |

### Manifest schema (draft)

[schema/manifest.schema.json](./schema/manifest.schema.json) validates `rules/manifest.yaml` on every `npm run validate` ([scripts/validate-manifest-schema.mjs](./scripts/validate-manifest-schema.mjs)).

---

## Rule record schema (normative intent)

Every machine-enforceable rule **should** eventually export these fields (see HIG §7.1):

```yaml
id: HIG-A11Y-004
severity: error          # error | warning | info
requirement: "Icon-only controls MUST have an accessible name."
archetypes: [application, commerce, auth, content]
autofix: safe            # safe | unsafe | none
exceptions:
  - documented_in: hig_exception_registry
hig_section: "§5.2"
module: rules/accessibility.md
maturity: stable          # stable | experimental | informative
minimum_browser_target: "Project supported browser matrix"
fallback: "What still works when the preferred technique is absent"
automated_checks: "What a static or runtime check may flag"
manual_checks: "What a person still confirms"
source_date: "2026-11-13"
```

The six consumption fields are required in [rules/agent-consumption.yaml](./rules/agent-consumption.yaml) for the accessibility, forms, motion, and performance IDs. They are packaging for agents and auditors. They do not change severity, WCAG mappings, or conformance scores. Other IDs keep the fields above as the normative intent until a later review fills them.

Agent guardrails in product repos are **projections** of this schema — not a second standard.

## Rule registry (`rules/registry.yaml`)

**Status:** Shipped (initial) — see [NPM-TOOLING.md](./NPM-TOOLING.md).

- One record per rule ID in [rules/INDEX.md](./rules/INDEX.md)
- Regenerate: `npm run sync:registry` ([scripts/sync-registry.mjs](./scripts/sync-registry.mjs))
- Validated in CI against INDEX, manifest, and VERSION

Export formats (ESLint metadata, PR bots, MCP) remain on the [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md).

---

## `eslint-plugin-hig` — deferred

**Not shipped in this repository.** ROADMAP and HIG §7.2 describe a reference ESLint plugin; today enforcement is:

- Layer 7 guardrails in agent templates and `web-hig check` (static CSS subset)
- Full multidimensional reporting via [EVALUATOR.md](./EVALUATOR.md) + [schema/evaluator-report.schema.json](./schema/evaluator-report.schema.json)

A future `eslint-plugin-hig` would implement only a **static subset** of the contract — not a substitute for runtime audit or manual WCAG review.

---

## Intended linter surface (future plugin)

Reference list from [rules/ai-enforcement.md](./rules/ai-enforcement.md):

| Rule | Intent |
| --- | --- |
| `hig/enforce-container-queries` | Component layout uses `@container` |
| `hig/streaming-boundary` | Slow async regions have streaming boundaries |
| `hig/no-unlabeled-icon-buttons` | Accessible names on icon controls |
| `hig/micro-animation-budget` | Motion ≤300 ms, tokenized durations |
| `hig/no-optimistic-destructive` | No optimistic destructive mutations |
| `hig/no-transition-all` | Ban `transition: all` in app CSS |

Implementations may live in a separate `eslint-plugin-hig` repository to keep this repo specification-only.

---

## Validation in consumer repos

Minimum:

```bash
# In a clone of github.com/frozonfreak/webhig at tag vX.Y.Z
npm run validate
```

Recommended when vendoring `docs/hig/`:

- Pin `docs/hig/VERSION`
- Run validate on upgrade PRs
- Add CI that fails when VERSION ≠ agent rule declared version

---

## Contributing machine-readable artifacts

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Changes to rule IDs or severity require:

1. HIG.md update
2. Matching `rules/*.md` module
3. [rules/manifest.yaml](./rules/manifest.yaml) / INDEX updates
4. [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) entry under appropriate semver bump
